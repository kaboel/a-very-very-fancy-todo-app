# The Frontend

This is the frontend for the fancy todo app, built using **Vite** + **React** + **TypeScript** and **MaterialUI**.

State management is handled by **Redux** with **Redux Toolkit**.

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Development mode

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server using Vite. This will run the frontend locally and allow you to work on the app.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should be running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) by default.
